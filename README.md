### Purpose: 
yaml2terragrunt is an open-source project designed to enable the dynamic creation of Terragrunt files, folders, and configurations using a declarative YAML approach. The primary objective is to simplify and streamline the management of complex infrastructure-as-code setups, particularly for organizations dealing with multiple environments, regions, and services.


### Aim:
The project aims to address several shortcomings of traditional Terragrunt folder structures:

1. Scalability issues: As projects grow, maintaining a consistent folder structure across multiple environments and regions becomes challenging.

2. Duplication of code: Traditional approaches often lead to repetitive configurations, violating the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

3. Limited flexibility: Static configurations make it difficult to share complex variables or computed values across different levels of the hierarchy.

4. Complexity in reorganization: Restructuring existing Terragrunt projects can be cumbersome and error-prone.


### Future objectives:
Future objectives for yaml2terragrunt may include:

1. Enhancing support for multi-region and multi-environment setups.
2. Implementing advanced features for dynamic configuration generation.
3. Developing tools to facilitate easier migration from existing Terragrunt structures.
4. Improving integration with other infrastructure-as-code tools and workflows.

### Summary:
By addressing these challenges, yaml2terragrunt aims to provide a more flexible, maintainable, and scalable approach to managing Terragrunt configurations for complex infrastructure projects.
